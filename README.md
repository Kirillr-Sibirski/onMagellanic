A productivity dapp that will help users to have more conscious life. Increase concentration during work times or help relax more effectively by incentivizing users using awards such as completion NFTs and reward in native tokens.
  
Users enter a website, connect MetaMask and choose a challenge of their choice. They stake a set amount of native tokens (COUNs) at 10% APY for amount of time that is set for every challenge. To start a specific task (meditation) they click a button start, users have to do this task for a specific amount of time (10 min). By completion of the task, users click stop button but if they click too early or too late - staked amount wouldnâ€™t be returned, however if they do manage to complete at specific time limits- congrats! They receive a non-transferable NFT that is specific to challenge they completed.
